    \begin{wideitemize}
        \item Opioid misuse can lead the victims to negative Labor Market Outcomes (\textcolor{fblu}{LMOs})
        \item The impact of substance abuse on LMOs might be mediated by labor market regulations
        \item \textcolor{fblu}{Minimum wage rates} can affect this impact 
        \vspace{9pt}
        \begin{wideitemize}
            \item[\textcolor{fblu}{\textbullet}] Negatively, through their effect on \textcolor{fblu}{labor demand for low-skill jobs} 
            \item[\textcolor{fblu}{\textbullet}] Positively, if they address the reasons that cause \textcolor{fblu}{addiction} in the first place \(\to\) \textcolor{fblu}{Deaths of despair}
        \end{wideitemize}
        %\item The dominance of each effect depends on how \textcolor{fblu}{binding} minimum wage rates are across labor markets
        \item How \textcolor{fblu}{binding} minimum wage rates are across labor markets is the relevant measure

    \begin{wideitemize}
        \item Do the effects of \textcolor{fblu}{Opioid Use Disorders} (\textcolor{fblu}{OUDs}) on labor market outcomes vary depending on minimum wage bindingness?
        %\item If so, how have these policies shaped the ongoing Crisis?
        %\item Is the interaction homogeneous across States, or can we expect differences across labor markets?
    \end{wideitemize}

    \vspace{9pt}
    I will use \textcolor{fblu}{changes in state prescription drug regulations} as a source of variation
    \vspace{9pt} 
    
    \begin{wideitemize}
        \item These changes can be seen as \textcolor{fblu}{exogeneous} from the \textcolor{fblu}{county level}

    \begin{wideitemize}
        \item Minimum wage bindingness can affect the decision of the worker to quit opioids
        \item This impact is \textcolor{fblu}{ambiguous} and depends on the \textcolor{fblu}{cost of quitting} and the \textcolor{fblu}{impact of addiction on productivity}
        \item Unless minimum wages force the worker to quit strongly enough, we should see a \textcolor{fblu}{negative impact on employment rates} where the minimum wage is \textcolor{fblu}{more binding}
