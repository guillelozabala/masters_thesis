 abstract = {The standard model used to theoretically and empirically investigate minimum wage effects on labor market outcomes views individuals and firms operating in stochastic environments that are governed by probabilistic laws that do not change over time. This is clearly an abstraction from reality, but for purposes of examining minimum wage effects, it may not be too egregious an assumption for a number of reasons. Most individuals paid the minimum wage are young, as we saw in the previous chapter, and as a result the impacts of minimum wage laws on labor market careers are largely concentrated in the first few},
