> **Do States Have to Follow the Federal Minimum Wage?**
>
> States are required to follow federal minimum wage law. States can pass their own laws to make the wage higher, equal to or lower than the federal law, but they can’t make >other changes that overrule the federal law, for instance, who is exempt or how many hours constitutes a work week.
>
> Federal minimum wage overrides state if the state wage is lower. It doesn’t if the state wage is higher. Hourly workers who come under Fair Labor Standard Act guidelines, which >most hourly workers do, always get the higher wage. Some cities have higher minimum wage laws than their state wage. In those cases, too, the higher wage prevails.
>
> If a state has no minimum wage law, the federal wage prevails.

> **What Happens if a State’s Minimum Wage Is Lower Than the Federal Minimum Wage?**
>
> In places where the state minimum wage is lower than the federal wage, workers who come under the Fair Labor Standards Act earn the federal wage.
>
> If workers don’t come under the FLSA, they can be paid less. Georgia, Oklahoma and Wyoming have minimum wages lower than the federal wage.
>
> Georgia and Wyoming’s are both $5.15 an hour. In Oklahoma employers pay the federal minimum wage if their business is a certain size that’s more generous than federal requirements. If not, workers get $2 an hour.
